# FYPJ_AI_MALWARE

# Week 1 
* Research on malware using AI and Sandbox Technology.
* Read and analyse what previous NYP researchers did.

### Challenge 
    - Fix Kaelan's unzip.py
        * Now able to unzip .7z, .rar, .zip folders regardless of OS.



# Week 2 
## Official Work starts
### Preprocess malware Portable Executables

* Research on malware using AI and Sandbox Technology.
* Read and analyse what previous NYP researchers did.
* Use pre-trained VGG19 model to train with pre-processed data.

### Challenge 
    - Create Python scripts.
        1. convert_pdf_doc.py
            - Convert PDFs and Word Documents into grayscale images.

        2. convert_bin_to_img.py
            - Convert compiled malware (i.e., .msi, .exe, .jar) into grayscale images.

        3. resize.py
            - Able to resize original images in directory to specific width and height

        4. train_test_split.py
            - Split datasets in to train and test folders.


# Week 3
* Use pre-trained VGG19 model to train with pre-processed data.

### Challenge 
    - Merge Python script into a singular file with python parser module.
        1. bin_to_img.py
            - Convert any files including malwares into grayscale images.


### Troubleshoot
    - Edit the notebook to allow grayscale image as input_data

### Lesson Learnt
    There is another way in preprocessing data. Basically, get the training datasets that are grouped in classes and convert them to numpy array immediately. Do not need to waste time and disk space for the pre-processed images.
